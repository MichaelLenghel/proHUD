Repository which holds code for a processing CA which is to make a sci-fi movie device like a warp drive, engine or weapons system.

Instructions for use:
On start up, click the blue button in the center to enter the spaceship. The last five stars scanned will be added to the pie chart and it can be paused to stop it from checking the most recent stars scanned. Can also enter warp drive with the button. Make sure the minim library is downloaded

I coded the assignment trying to implement all of the necessary features, i.e. vectors, abstract classes, interfaces and matrices (push and pop).

I am most proud of the pod class which uses vectors to to track the scanner. This was particularly difficult to mkae for me since I have never used vectors and had how ot use them while coding it. This lead to a lot of errors, hopefully all patched now.
